    "## 1. SQL Query Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This query is designed to extract all necessary raw data from 8 different tables and combine them into a single, clean table for analysis.\n",
    "Here are the key logical decisions:\n",
    "1. `WITH` Clauses (CTEs): Before the main query, two temporary \"mini-tables\" (`items_agg` and `payments_agg`) were created using Common Table Expressions.\n",
    "* Why? The `order_items` and `order_payments` tables have a one-to-many relationship with `orders` (one order can have many items). A simple `JOIN` would cause massive data duplication (a \"fan-out\"), making all `SUM()` calculations incorrect.\n",
    "* Solution: We first pre-aggregate (using `SUM()` and `GROUP BY`) these tables to get a single row per order_id, which we can then safely join.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `LEFT JOIN`: The main query uses `LEFT JOIN` instead of a standard `INNER JOIN`.\n",
    "* Why? Our goal is to analyze all delivered orders from the main `olist_orders_dataset table`.\n",
    "Problem: If we used an `INNER JOIN`, any order that was missing a review (or a customer record) would be dropped from our analysis. This would skew our results.\n",
    "* Solution: `LEFT JOIN` ensures that we keep all rows from the \"left\" table (`olist_orders_dataset`) and simply fill in `NULL` values for any missing data from the \"right\" tables (like `review_score`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `WHERE` Clause: The query filters for `order_status = 'delivered'` and checks for `IS NOT NULL`.\n",
    "* Why? We can only analyze customer satisfaction on orders that were actually completed. Filtering out canceled or shipped orders, as well as rows with missing data, ensures our final dataset is clean and relevant to the business problem."
